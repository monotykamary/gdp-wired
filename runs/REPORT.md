# Track P report

Base: `40693c7a`; branch: `claude/track-paxos`.

**Status: active follow-up; original production target NOT proven and not eligible to merge.** The initial checkpoint below is retained as history. Work continues with exported check-only certificates, full wall-time accounting, six minimal-certificate diffs, and per-phase profiling. No gate success is inferred from scheduler exit status.

## Implementation

- Integrated the supplied generic carry, scan-prefix, and counted-support generators and their tests. Prefix generation is consolidated in `core/carry.ts`.
- Added `core/relevance.ts`: bounded deterministic relevance subsets, lifting trees and count certificates back to the exact full context. Subset failure or SAT is not a whole-context result. Production law-context pruning is opt-in.
- Improved selected-count proposals: relevant keyless before/after/incoming comparisons, upper-bound nonincrease/overlap priorities, live referenced-read projection, and exact affine remainder matching. Complete original guarded laws are instantiated; no packed-coordinate equality is assumed.
- Start with preferred existing count instances when seeded bounds exist; retain the lazy pool. Deduplicate symmetric complete instantiated term premises rather than filling source slots twice. Reuse count proposal pools when only primitive PRE support grows; follow count-dependent flags transitively for invalidation. Every retained view is reified and final certificates are checked.
- Archival duplicate files in `research/claude-import/` are excluded from type/lint discovery, not from integrated engine tests.
- No kernel, Lean, model, original-law, proof-budget, or external-solver change. Experimental ordering switches remain off by default.

## Commands and observed results

Every substantive run used boat; timing runs used `--vm-type large --timing`.

### Integration and production recapture

```
supercomputer run --jobs research/track-p-jobs.json --out runs/track-p-import-check --class interactive --vm-type large
supercomputer run --jobs research/track-p/experiment-jobs.json --out runs/track-p-fast-v1 --class interactive --vm-type large --timing --data runs/track-p-data:research/track-p/input
```

Initial integration tests: 53 passed, 0 failed, 1173 assertions. Initial check failures from absent pinned submodules and imported helper typing were repaired; final check result is below.

Original harness `run.ts --ms 60000 --only paxos_epr --skip broken`, tree `f1791b206089`: **unknown**, observed 89,328ms wall, 12,997,648 work. This fails strict 60 seconds. Generated 77 candidates; Houdini ended with 29, with safety C7 open. C7 had proved under the larger context before its supports were removed. Capture: 458 model SAT, 91 model unknown, 148 grow trees, 16 grow unknown. Archive: `runs/track-p-fast-v1/dump.tar.xz`.

`runs/track-p-candidates/candidates.log`: **19/19 reference-family formulas generated** (15 exact names, 4 alpha-equivalent generated names). Historical laws are never injected into production.

### Fast-loop relevance and family baseline

Five historical unknown queries were replayed in pairs at 1500 counted ms. Goals of 174, 196, 204 and 210 hypotheses remained unknown at depth zero; a 104-hypothesis abstraction was SAT. Hypothesis relevance produced **no checked proof flips**. These SATs are not reachable counterexamples.

```
supercomputer run --jobs research/track-p/family-jobs.json --out runs/track-p-family-v1 --class submission --vm-type large --timing --data runs/track-p-data:research/track-p/input
```

Initial generic family replay checked **32/38 obligations**, in both full-hypothesis and relevance modes. The complete v5 replay (`runs/track-p-family-v5/`, tree `f11a474c1b70`) still checked 32/38 in each mode. All INITs checked. STEP indices 7, 10, 11, 17, 33, 66 remained open (10 returned SAT for an incomplete abstraction; others unknown). This is standalone generic-proposal replay, not production family admission. Tree results were checked with `checkMC` against original obligations.

### C9 and C11: independently checked

Evidence: `runs/track-p-gaps/REPORT.md`, `recheck-run/recheck.log`, retained requests/trees, and complete investigation source in `runs/track-p-gap-source/`. Fixture SHA256:

```
ee4bee5547e52dc7222e210f1a188e9adb1b81fe542eb01396cacba26e7007f1
```

- C9 STEP checks with its own PRE law (17 hypotheses, observed 163ms), and with family19 (22 hypotheses, 115ms). Two comparisons suffice: old-minus-post and incoming-minus-post, at actual selected reads. Removing a count witness rejects retained certificates.
- C11 STEP checks with family19: 37 encoded hypotheses, observed 205.63ms. Reduced alternative: **32 hypotheses, 364.05ms**, using C33[a,b,pv] and C45[wMeet,a,b], without quantified C3/C61 instances.
- Fresh replay regenerated the original goal, verified source binding, and checked certificates again. These are derivability results, not production discovery or whole-family admission.
- Existing arithmetic proves equality of the packed prefix and low digit from equal full keys and low-digit bounds. Individual node/round cancellation is false; explicit SAT counterexamples are retained. No unsound coordinate identity was added.

### Concrete search failures and final bounded changes

The emitter audits identified:

1. Four cold C33 coordinate proposals filled its four slots before needed C33[a,b,pv] arrived. Whole-premise symmetry deduplication in a standalone scheduling control emitted that tuple on the next pass.
2. Repeated pool construction consumed the shared **65536-work** generation limit before C70's next closure pass. C70 appeared with the hand-selected request.
3. A temporary two-slot reservation failed because the first sparse pass refilled the slots. A coarse all-flags cache was invalidated by primitive rowOk because an unrelated flag read counts.

The final implementation instead deduplicates symmetric term premises at both admission sites and follows only actual/transitive count-dependent flag instances for pool invalidation. The v5/v6 regression caught lower-quality cold sources backfilling freed slots, including through the generic partial-read fallback. The final selector preserves exact write-key donor priority in both paths; its regression requires both distinct roots with no symmetric or unrelated-value backfill. Budgets are unchanged.

V5 and V6 strict checks passed (0 errors/warnings); each had 53/54 targeted tests pass before the complete backfill fix. V5 generic C9 checked at 53 hypotheses (227ms full, 269ms relevance). C11 remained unknown at 99 hypotheses, zero case splits (1524ms full, 1301ms relevance). This is a proof-search timeout, not the six-round observation ceiling or a counterexample.

Final command:

```
supercomputer run --jobs research/track-p/focused-v7-jobs.json --out runs/track-p-final-validation --class interactive --vm-type large --data runs/track-p-data:research/track-p/input
```

The exclusive-timing v7 batch (`20261107-235739-41327e`) remained wholly queued behind other real work and was explicitly cancelled/closed with zero VMs or starts. Final validation uses shared large-VM slots; its timings are **not benchmark evidence**.

Final source tree `28dca86ad30b`, `runs/track-p-final-validation/`:

- `bun run check`: **passed**, zero warnings/errors (903 files).
- Targeted support/carry/prefix/relevance tests: **54 passed, 0 failed, 914 assertions**.
- Generic C9 INIT and STEP: **checked** in both modes; STEP uses 53 encoded hypotheses.
- Generic C11 INIT: **checked**. C11 STEP: **unknown**, 99 encoded hypotheses, zero case splits, round 3; this is a proof-search time exhaustion, not the six-round observation ceiling.
- The residual wall is now explicit: the generic search still fails on a 99-hypothesis C11 context while a source-bound 32-hypothesis certificate checks. The five other open family obligations in the complete v5 replay also prevent family admission. Hypothesis-pruning experiments did not turn those into checked production proofs.

No final-run timing is used as benchmark evidence because that validation shared its large VM.

## Follow-up: certificates and 89.328-second wall-time accounting

Both requested certificates are exported to `runs/track-p-certs/{c9,c11}/{goal.json,proof.json}` in the C14 pack format. Fresh boat check-only replay returned true for both, with `searchWork: 0`, no nonzero search costs, and witness-removal controls rejected. C9 has 17 encoded hypotheses; C11 has 32. Hashes and source bindings are in that directory.

The original `DUMP_MIN=0` ledger contains **713 root queries**. `research/query/dump.ts` records wall milliseconds, and the root hooks suppress nested logging; these totals are disjoint. Exact accounting source: `runs/track-p-fast-v1/timing-accounting.json` (ledger SHA256 `c2b2ba00d188f9c1698448f7b89368fbe143fe5a53859d7c06ffff86e7762c37`).

| Root outcome | Queries | Total wall ms |
|---|---:|---:|
| proved (`tree`) | 148 | 1,379 |
| unknown | 107 | 7,347 |
| SAT | 458 | 47,516 |
| all roots | 713 | 56,242 |
| outside root queries | — | 33,086 |

549 model queries consumed 54,862ms; 164 grow queries consumed 1,380ms. Thus the six open STEPs' failed proof attempts are **not the entire overshoot**: SAT/model search and time outside the root queries dominate. The 187 traced per-law attempts total 73,060ms, comprising 56,242ms in root queries and 16,818ms between/around their queries. Another 16,268ms lies outside those traced attempts.

**Generation of the 19 laws was not wall-timestamped in this capture.** The log's `candidates at 0 ms` uses the counted `clock()`, not wall time, and cannot support a zero-generation-time claim. The 16,268ms outside attempts includes generation, early small-state work and other admission/control overhead; it cannot honestly be assigned to generation alone. A generation-only replay will measure these phases explicitly without rerunning full production.

| Rank | Ledger index (zero based) | Kind / recorded name | Hyps | Outcome | Wall ms |
|---:|---:|---|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | 459 | model / counted | 122 | unknown | 2,068 |
| 2 | 362 | model / counted | 318 | SAT | 1,967 |
| 3 | 157 | model / counted | 289 | SAT | 1,728 |
| 4 | 453 | model / counted | 279 | SAT | 1,727 |
| 5 | 474 | model / counted | 223 | SAT | 1,357 |
| 6 | 329 | model / counted | 219 | SAT | 1,258 |
| 7 | 419 | model / counted | 252 | SAT | 1,244 |
| 8 | 471 | model / counted | 195 | SAT | 1,157 |
| 9 | 122 | model / counted | 152 | SAT | 1,138 |
| 10 | 340 | model / counted | 238 | SAT | 997 |

The dump records these goals as `counted`; it does not preserve their owning law name. The ledger indices above identify them exactly. No invented law attribution or retrospective generation timestamp is used.

## Gates and disposition

The target has not passed 3 x strict 60s. Thus later paired IC3Syn 29 x 3, DuoAI ten paired, 29 broken, seven test shards, and quick-bar gates were **not advanced or claimed**. No main-branch merge or publish action. Checked hand proofs establish that the C9/C11 barrier is search scheduling/instantiation, not an unsupported trusted lemma.
